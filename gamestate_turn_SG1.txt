<p class="mb-2 pb-1 border-b border-amber-700/50"><i class="ra ra-quill mr-2"></i>Welcome to Pedena, JulesTest! Your adventure begins in Pedena Town Square.</p><p class="mb-2 pb-1 border-b border-amber-700/50"><i class="ra ra-quill mr-2"></i>The midday sun beat down on Pedena Town Square, baking the cobblestones to a shimmering haze. JulesTest, a Level 1 warrior barely out of their apprenticeship, felt the weight of their worn leather jerkin – a far cry from the gleaming plate armor of the heroes in tavern tales. But today, that weight felt different. Today, a crumpled, blood-stained parchment clutched in their hand held more significance than any king's decree. The cryptic message spoke of a stolen relic, a forgotten power slumbering beneath the Whispering Moors – and JulesTest, despite their inexperience, was the only one brave (or foolish) enough to answer the call. A ragged laugh escaped their lips. This was it.
