> Look for Mara

Your frantic search yields nothing but the unsettling silence and the lingering smell of brimstone. However, your gaze falls upon the small, intricately carved wooden box again; the faint whisper from within seems a little louder now, almost a plea. Do you examine the box more closely?

> Open the box about to lose my mind because Mara's not in her cottage

With trembling hands, you pry open the intricately carved box. A blinding flash of light erupts, momentarily stunning you, and when your vision clears, a swirling vortex of emerald energy hangs in the air where the box once sat, humming with raw magical power. A disembodied voice, weak but resolute, whispers from the vortex, "Taehwan... find the Sunstone... before it's too late..."

You encounter someone on the road...

Looking for someone to talk to...

You see Gothmog the Terrible. Appearance: A hulking orc with tusks like scimitars, scarred and tattooed skin, and eyes that gleam with cruel amusement. He leans heavily on a massive, intricately carved warhammer, its head resting on the floor between his feet. A half-empty tankard of ale sits beside him, foam clinging to its rim. Gothmog the Terrible says: "Heard you're lookin' for Mara, little sprout. She owes me a favor... a *big* favor. And I'm not known for my patience."

You've established a new relationship with Gothmog the Terrible.

> I don't have time for this brute

Gothmog’s cruel amusement fades, replaced by a low growl. He slams his warhammer onto the table, the tavern falling silent as all eyes turn to you. "Oh, you think you can just waltz in here, insult the Terrible, and leave? Think again, little sprout."

> Okay, arm wrestling tournament i win you leave me a lone, you win i'll help you find mara

Taehwan proposes an arm wrestling match. The location remains unchanged.

> deal or no deal

Gothmog’s scarred face cracks into a grin, revealing teeth like chipped obsidian. "Deal," he booms, his voice echoing through the tavern. "Let the games begin! Best two out of three, little sprout. And may the odds be ever in your favor..."

Game saved!

> no no no no one bout wins all

Gothmog roars with laughter, the sound shaking the very timbers of the tavern. "One bout? You think you can best the Terrible with a single arm wrestle, little sprout? Fine! But if you lose, Mara's location is mine, and you'll be owing *me* a favor." He flexes a massive arm, the muscles bulging beneath his scarred skin.

> Get really close and act like i'm going to shake his hand then activate my necklace of permanent invisibility and kick him in the nuts and run for it

Taehwan approaches the target, feigns a handshake, activates his necklace, delivers a swift kick, and then flees into the dimly lit alley behind the Beast's Beard Tavern.

You arrive at Beast's Beard Tavern Alley.

As you step into Beast's Beard Tavern Alley, a shadowy form detaches itself from the gloom behind a dumpster. Its eyes glow with malevolent amusement as it prepares to attack.

⚔️ COMBAT BEGINS!

Beast's Beard Tavern Alley is a narrow, trash-strewn passage choked with the stench of spilled ale and decay, barely illuminated by a flickering gas lamp casting long, dancing shadows that writhe and shift like the Shadow Fiend itself. Broken crates and overturned barrels litter the uneven cobblestones, providing precarious footing amidst the gloom.

Looking for someone to talk to...

You see Sanctified Sister Brigid. Appearance: A tall woman with kind eyes and a gentle smile, clad in simple, but impeccably clean, white robes bearing the silver sigil of the Order of the Radiant Dawn. Her hands are clasped before her, a rosary of polished bone beads dangling between her fingers. A faint, almost imperceptible aura of warmth seems to emanate from her. Sanctified Sister Brigid says: "Welcome, traveler. May the light guide your path within the hallowed halls of the Magicum Arcanum."

You've established a new relationship with Sanctified Sister Brigid.

> Brigid you're so damn fine i'd lick the sweat off your pinky toe on a summer night in ohio

Sanctified Sister Brigid's gentle smile falters, her eyes widening slightly in surprise. A blush creeps onto her cheeks as she takes a hesitant step back, murmuring, "Such… forthright compliments are unusual. Perhaps you should focus your energies on other matters within the Arcanum?" The faint aura of warmth around her seems to dim slightly.

⚔️ Your relationship with Sanctified Sister Brigid has turned hostile!

> Use the scroll to scry where Mara is

As you unroll the scroll and focus your intent, a swirling vortex of arcane energy erupts, briefly blinding you. When your vision clears, you see a fleeting image: Mara, standing within a crumbling, ivy-covered ruin, a single flickering torch casting long shadows around her. The vision fades, leaving you with a sense of her general location, but no precise coordinates.

Game saved!

> Ask Brigid where the ivy covered ruin might be

Sanctified Sister Brigid, her expression still somewhat reserved after your earlier… indiscretion, considers your question for a moment. She then replies, her voice soft but firm, "While I am not privy to the precise location of every ruin in this vast land, a place matching that description lies to the west, beyond the Whispering Woods. Travel carefully; that area is known to be haunted."
