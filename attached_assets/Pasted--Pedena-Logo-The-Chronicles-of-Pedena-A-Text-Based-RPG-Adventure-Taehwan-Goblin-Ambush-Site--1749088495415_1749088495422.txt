New quest available: Echoes of the Shattered Mirror

A cloaked figure, their voice echoing with ancient power, appeared in Magnus Tyrum's throne room, their words hinting at a forgotten ritual involving a mirror reflecting a fractured realm. This mirror, they claim, holds the key to a power capable of reshaping reality itself, a power that could even affect the outcome of the Saint Celestine Question, your recent investigation. Only a mage of your skill, they insisted, can navigate the perilous path to its heart.

Objective: Locate the Obsidian Mirror, navigate the shattered reflection it reveals, and retrieve a shard of its fragmented power, known as a 'Mirror Shard'.

Rewards: 210 gold, 1050 XP, Mirror Shard, Greater Healing Potion, Scroll of Greater Fireball

Difficulty: Hard | Estimated Time: 1-2 hours

Complication: The shattered reflection within the Obsidian Mirror is not merely a visual effect; it's a dangerous, unstable plane of existence filled with creatures warped by the mirror's power. Navigating this plane requires skillful use of magic and quick thinking. The Shadow Weaver's true motives remain ambiguous; are they truly benevolent, or do they seek to exploit the mirror's power for their own ends?

Quest Giver: The Shadow Weaver – A mysterious figure cloaked in darkness, their motives unclear but their knowledge of ancient magic undeniable. | Location: The Whispering Cairns (a newly discovered network of ancient ruins)

New quest available: The Fractured Mirror's Reflection

Magnus Tyrum's cryptic words still echo in your ears, hinting at a mirror reflecting a fractured realm – a realm whose fate is intertwined with the Saint Celestine Question. This mirror, he implied, holds a power capable of reshaping reality itself, a power only a mage of your caliber can access. But the path to this mirror is fraught with peril, guarded by ancient guardians and riddled with magical traps.

Objective: Locate the hidden chamber containing the Shattered Mirror within the ruins of Eldoria, decipher its arcane inscriptions, and stabilize the fractured reflection within.

Rewards: 210 gold, 1050 XP, Greater Healing Potion, Arcane Focus

Difficulty: Hard | Estimated Time: 1-2 hours

Complication: The Eldorian ruins are infested with powerful elemental guardians, animated by the fractured realm's residual magic. Furthermore, a rival mage, seeking the mirror's power for their own nefarious purposes, may be lurking within the ruins, actively obstructing your progress.

Quest Giver: Magnus Tyrum, a powerful and enigmatic figure who appeared as a shimmering image in the throne room. | Location: Ruins of Eldoria

> buy a Necklace of Permanent Invisibility

The air crackles with arcane energy as the shopkeeper, a wizened gnome with twinkling eyes, examines your gold. He nods, a sly grin spreading across his face, and produces a delicate silver necklace, the pendant a shimmering obsidian teardrop that seems to absorb the light around it. For 800 gold pieces, the Necklace of Permanent Invisibility is yours.

You lost 800 gold (purchase)!

> Travel to the Magnus Tyrum Bank

Taehwan, with a flick of his wrist and a muttered incantation, teleports directly to the grand hall of the Magnus Tyrum Bank. The air hums with arcane energy for a moment before fading.

You arrive at Magnus Tyrum Bank Grand Hall.

Travel time: Instantly

Game saved!

> Activate my necklace of permanent invisibility

The obsidian teardrop on your necklace pulses with faint light, then fades completely. A wave of cool energy washes over you as you become utterly invisible, the very air seeming to shift around your form. The bustling hall of the Magnus Tyrum Bank remains oblivious to your presence.

> wait for the back door to be opened then slip in

The grand hall hums with activity, but the back door remains stubbornly shut. After what feels like an eternity, a gruff guard unlocks it, briefly glancing inside before leaving it ajar. Your invisibility cloak holds, allowing you to slip silently into the dimly lit back passage.

> find any valuables

The musty air hangs heavy with the scent of old parchment and forgotten treasures. You discover a small, iron strongbox tucked away in a shadowed corner, its lock surprisingly flimsy. Inside, nestled amongst faded ledgers, lies a pouch containing 750 gold pieces and a single, intricately carved ivory amulet.

You gained 750 gold (loot)!

> teleport to the Amazonian Brothel

A surge of arcane energy washes over you as you attempt the teleport, but the spell fizzles, leaving you disoriented and slightly nauseous. The air crackles with residual magic, and you realize the bank's potent wards are interfering with your spell. You remain in the Magnus Tyrum Bank Grand Hall.

> exit the bank

Taehwan exits the grand hall of the Magnus Tyrum Bank and steps out onto the bustling city streets.

You arrive at Magnus Tyrum City Streets.

Travel time: a few moments

Game saved!

> Turn off my necklace of invisibility's ward

The obsidian teardrop on your necklace warms slightly as you deactivate its magic, and the world snaps back into sharp focus. Sunlight glints off the bustling city streets, and you're once again visible to all. The feeling of being unseen is replaced by a pleasant sense of normalcy.

Game saved!

You offer a prayer to the gods...

The gods listen but remain silent.

> Travel to the outskirts of town

Taehwan walks along the cobblestone streets, gradually leaving the bustling city center behind. The buildings become sparser, replaced by fields and the occasional small farmstead. The air smells fresher, carrying the scent of earth and wildflowers.

You arrive at Magnus Tyrum City Outskirts.

Travel time: approximately 30 minutes

> Hunt goblins

A ragged band of five goblins, their crude weapons glinting dully in the afternoon sun, emerges from the shadows of a crumbling stone wall. They chatter amongst themselves, noticing you only when one lets out a surprised yelp. The air crackles with anticipation as they prepare for a fight.

> Shoot the lead goblin in the eye with my light crossbow

Your light crossbow fires with a sharp *twang*, the bolt finding its mark with deadly accuracy. The lead goblin shrieks, clutching at its eye as it stumbles backward, its comrades momentarily stunned by the swift, precise strike. The remaining goblins, however, raise their crude weapons, a furious growl rising from their throats as they charge.

> Shoot another goblin in the eye

Your bolt flies true, another piercing shriek echoing as a second goblin collapses, clutching at a bleeding eye socket. The remaining three goblins, momentarily unnerved by your deadly accuracy, hesitate before renewing their frenzied charge, weapons swinging wildly.

> Shoot another goblin in the eye

Your bolt whizzes through the air, but one of the remaining goblins, surprisingly agile, ducks the shot. The projectile thuds harmlessly into the ground. The goblins, emboldened by your near miss, close the distance with renewed ferocity, their crude weapons slashing at you.

> Shoot the one that dodged in the foot

Your bolt finds its mark, a yelp of pain escaping the goblin as it stumbles, clutching its wounded foot. The remaining two goblins, momentarily distracted, press their attack with slightly less ferocity, giving you a brief respite.

> Shoot the next goblin in the throat

Your bolt flies true, a sickening thud echoing as the remaining goblin collapses, clutching its throat. Blood gurgles from the wound as the creature falls lifeless to the ground, leaving only one goblin remaining. Its eyes widen in fear, its weapon momentarily forgotten.

> Run up on all the goblins with my dagger to finish them off and loot their corpses

Taehwan sprints towards the sounds of goblin chatter, his dagger drawn, weaving through sparse undergrowth at the city's edge.

You arrive at Goblin Ambush Site, Magnus Tyrum City Outskirts.
