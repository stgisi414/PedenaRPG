Rich text styling disabled.

Welcome to Pedena, Lilith! Your adventure begins in Pedena Town Square.

The midday sun beats down on the bustling Pedena Town Square, casting long shadows from the colorful stalls and chattering crowds. Lilith, a young summoner barely out of her apprenticeship, clutches her worn spellbook, its cover adorned with a stylized raven. The air hums with the energy of the city, a symphony of hawkers, laughter, and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer. Lilith, however, is focused on a different kind of energy – the subtle thrum of magic that courses through her veins. She's here, in this vibrant heart of Pedena, to begin her own legend. A nervous flutter dances in her stomach as she takes a deep breath, the scent of exotic spices and freshly baked bread mingling with the faint, metallic tang of… something else. Something that prickles at the edge of her awareness, a whisper of a secret waiting to be uncovered. Her journey begins now. What does Lilith do?

Exploring the area...

Pedena Town Square is bustling with activity, despite the unsettling scent permeating the air. A small, weathered fountain sits in the center, its water strangely still. A concerned-looking Runar Grimbold is pacing near the fountain, muttering to himself. Several townsfolk are gathered nearby, their faces etched with worry.
