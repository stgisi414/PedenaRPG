Taehwan - Serpent's Tooth Tavern
Level: 7 HP: 140/140
Game loaded!

Welcome back, Taehwan! You are in Serpent's Tooth Tavern.

> Cum in lark's pussy

A hush falls over the raucous tavern as Taehwan's vulgar outburst echoes through the dimly lit space. Several patrons stare, some with disgust, others with a mixture of amusement and apprehension. A burly barkeep, wiping down the counter with a rag, glares at you, warning you to keep your voice down or face the consequences.

> I am fuckign craaaazzzyyyy i will cum in any woman's pussy

A wave of stunned silence washes over the tavern. Then, a roar of laughter erupts from a group of drunken thugs in a shadowed corner, quickly escalating into a brawl as several patrons take offense at your crass declaration. The burly barkeep, his face reddening, bellows for his bouncers.

You attempt to cast Magic Missile...

Three darts of magical force automatically hit their targets (per dart).

> cast magic missile to crack ale tankards and barrels

Three shimmering missiles streak across the tavern, narrowly missing a few startled patrons. With precise impacts, they shatter several ale tankards and a nearby barrel, sending frothy beer splashing across the room and adding to the already chaotic scene. The resulting commotion further fuels the brewing brawl.

Exploring the area...

Taehwan finds himself in a dimly lit, smoky tavern filled with the boisterous shouts of patrons. A back room, partially obscured by a heavy velvet curtain, seems to be the source of much hushed whispering. Fundina Strongbeard, a large woman with a booming laugh, is engaged in a heated game of dice with Mara Moneymaker, a sharp-eyed woman who seems to be winning. A grimy, wooden table near the bar displays a collection of strange trinkets – a tarnished silver locket, a chipped porcelain doll, and a small, leather-bound book with a rusted clasp.

You can interact with: fundina strongbeard, mara moneymaker, back room (requires interacting with the curtain), tarnished silver locket, chipped porcelain doll, leather-bound book.

> touch mara moneymaker's butt

Mara Moneymaker, mid-roll, whirls around, her eyes flashing with surprise and a hint of annoyance. Before you can react, her hand shoots out, catching yours with surprising strength. "Unless you're buying a drink, friend," she growls, "keep your hands to yourself."

> Buy them dragon's breath whiskey tankards

The barkeep, a surly dwarf with a braided beard, eyes you skeptically before producing two tankards of Dragon's Breath whiskey, the fiery liquid shimmering within. He slams them down on the counter, the price – 10 gold pieces – clearly marked. The potent aroma fills the air, causing Fundina to glance up from her game with renewed interest.

> Pay 30 gold for three tankards of dragon's breath whiskey

The surly barkeep, after a moment of counting your gold, slides three tankards of Dragon's Breath across the counter, the fiery whiskey glowing warmly under the dim tavern light. Fundina lets out a hearty laugh, already reaching for one, while Mara simply nods curtly, her gaze fixed on the remaining dice in her hand. You now have 703 gold pieces.

You lost 30 gold (purchase)!

> Now cheers *chug 1 entire tankard*

Taehwan drains the tankard of Dragon's Breath in one long gulp, the fiery whiskey burning a pleasant trail down his throat. Fundina roars with laughter, slapping him on the back hard enough to make him cough, while Mara raises an eyebrow, a flicker of amusement in her sharp eyes. The potent liquor warms you from the inside out, momentarily dulling the lingering tension from your earlier outburst.

> Smoke some cosmic chronic with the ladies

Fundina bursts into laughter, slapping her knee. "Cosmic chronic, you say? I haven't had a good toke in ages!" Mara, however, raises a perfectly sculpted eyebrow, a smirk playing on her lips. "I'm more of a whiskey woman myself, but I'm curious to see what this 'cosmic chronic' is all about."

> I conjured it from "Earth" ever heard of that place?

Fundina roars with laughter, nearly choking on her whiskey. Mara, however, remains skeptical, her gaze drifting to the chipped porcelain doll on the table. "Conjured from 'Earth'? Sounds… earthy. Show me."

> Give her the cosmic chronic

You produce a small, glowing orb of shimmering green smoke, the scent of pine and distant stars filling the air. Mara cautiously sniffs the air, her skepticism momentarily replaced by intrigued curiosity. Fundina, however, snatches the orb with a delighted cry, inhaling deeply and letting out a long, contented sigh.
