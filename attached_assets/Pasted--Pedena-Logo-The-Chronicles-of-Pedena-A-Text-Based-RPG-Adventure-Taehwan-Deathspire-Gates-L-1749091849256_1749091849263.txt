Level: 8 HP: 140/140
Game loaded!

Welcome back, Taehwan! You are in Deathspire Gates.

You notice Inquisitor Hadrian in the area.

> Attack a winged imp

A winged imp swoops down from a high crevice in the Deathspire Gates, its eyes gleaming with malevolent intent. It screeches and dives towards the mage.

‚öîÔ∏è COMBAT BEGINS!

Jagged obsidian shards litter the windswept precipice of Deathspire Gates, casting long, skeletal shadows in the fading twilight; a treacherous, uneven footing threatens both mage and imp alike as they clash amidst the crumbling remains of a cyclopean gate.

 (100/100 HP) vs Veteran Winged Imp (40/40 HP)

Turn 1: You act first!

üó°Ô∏è Your turn! Choose your action:

Commands: 'attack', 'defend', 'cast spell', 'use item', 'examine enemy', 'flee'

> use spell focus and spell power along with ice storm to make ice spears rain from the sky above the imp

With a fierce incantation, you focus your magical energies, drawing upon the raw power of the storm itself. Jagged spears of ice, born from the swirling vortex above, plummet from the heavens, impacting the Veteran Winged Imp with bone-jarring force. The imp shrieks as icy shards pierce its leathery wings and armor.
