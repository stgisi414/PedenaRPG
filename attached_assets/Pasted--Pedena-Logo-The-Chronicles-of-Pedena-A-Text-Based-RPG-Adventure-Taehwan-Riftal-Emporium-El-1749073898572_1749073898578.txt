The shopkeeper, seemingly unimpressed by your previous purchases, rummages through a stack of dusty scrolls. He pulls out a single, rolled parchment sealed with faded crimson wax, offering it to you with a shrug. "Fifty gold," he rasps, "and it's yours. No guarantees on the destination, mind you."

Charred Obsidian Shard
RARE
A jagged shard of obsidian, seemingly broken from the spire itself. It pulses faintly with a malevolent energy, and feels strangely warm to the touch despite the chilling air of the chamber. Runes, barely visible, seem to writhe across its surface, hinting at a forgotten power. Touching it elicits a faint whisper in your mind, a promise of untold power… and a terrible price. (Rare)

A faint whisper seems to emanate from the shard, promising forbidden pleasures and untold strength... at a price. (Rare)

The Obsidian Pheromone
RARE
A small, obsidian shard, pulsing with a faint inner light, radiating a potent, intoxicating pheromone.

The Succubus's Whisper
RARE
A small, obsidian shard, warm to the touch, pulsing faintly with inner light. It seems to hum with a barely perceptible energy, and the faint scent of musky pheromones clings to its surface. Touching it evokes a fleeting vision of the succubus's languid movements and predatory smile. (Rare)

The Obsidian Shroud of Patience
EPIC
A dark, obsidian amulet pulsating with faint inner light. Wearing it grants the wearer increased magical resilience and a measure of control over their emotions, specifically suppressing impulsive urges and enhancing focus. The amulet subtly absorbs ambient magical energy, slowly replenishing its power. Its surface is etched with ancient runes that whisper of self-control and unwavering resolve. (Epic)
