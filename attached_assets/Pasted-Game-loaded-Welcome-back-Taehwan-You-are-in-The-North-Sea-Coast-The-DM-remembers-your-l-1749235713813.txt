> cum on a mermaid

The old fisherman, Hector, stares at you, his rheumy eyes widening slightly. He lets out a cackle that sounds like wind whistling through broken timbers, then mutters something unintelligible in a dialect you don't understand, before returning to his net mending. Your inappropriate comment seems to have utterly baffled him.

> Travel to 울京

Taehwan, with a flick of his wrist and a muttered incantation, opens a shimmering portal. Stepping through, he finds himself in the bustling streets of Ulkyung, the salty air of the North Sea replaced by the scent of street food and commerce.

You arrive at The City of Ulkyung.

Travel time: a few minutes via magical portal

You encounter someone on the road...

Looking for someone to talk to...

You see The Living Glacier. Appearance: A towering figure, seemingly carved from ice and snow, yet radiating a strange inner warmth. Runes, glowing faintly blue, are etched across its glacial skin. Its eyes are pools of shimmering turquoise, ancient and knowing. The Living Glacier says: "The whispers of the North Sea carry secrets… some are worth seeking, others… best left undisturbed."

You've established a new relationship with The Living Glacier.

> Ignore the living glacier and move on to the city of 울京

Taehwan is already in the City of Ulkyung.

> Look for hot asian bitches

Taehwan's brazen comment earns him only a few curious glances from the bustling crowds of Ulkyung. The city, vibrant and alive, offers little in the way of immediate gratification for his crude request, though a nearby teahouse does seem to attract a particularly attractive clientele. Perhaps a more subtle approach is needed.

> Burst into the teahouse and demand sexy women

The doors of the teahouse burst inward, scattering startled patrons and sending teacups flying. Taehwan's demand is met with a mixture of gasps, shrieks, and the sharp crack of a nearby tea tray shattering on the floor. A burly, kimono-clad man emerges from behind the counter, a wicked-looking tanto glinting in his hand.

> Use my ability spell focus and cast mage hand and steal the tanto from the man and wave it around in the air frantically while mumbling 가나다라마바사아자차카타파하あかさたなはまやらわん

With a flick of your wrist and a muttered incantation, your Mage Hand darts out, snatching the tanto from the startled teahouse owner. You wave the blade wildly, the Korean and Japanese syllables tumbling from your lips in a nonsensical yet strangely intimidating torrent. The burly man, momentarily disarmed and thoroughly confused, stares at you with a mixture of disbelief and dawning fear.

> 한국말 안 하면 죽는다 모두!

The teahouse erupts in a cacophony of screams and panicked shouts as Taehwan's threat, delivered in fierce Korean, hangs heavy in the air. The burly owner, still reeling from the stolen tanto, looks around wildly, his face a mask of fear and confusion. A few patrons, understanding the gravity of the situation, begin to flee the scene, while others cower in terror, unsure of what to expect next.

Game saved!

> 한국말부터 해라!!! 모두!!!!!

The teahouse descends into utter chaos. Screams mingle with the clatter of fleeing patrons as your furious Korean command echoes through the room. The burly owner, eyes wide with terror, can only stammer incoherently, his hand reaching for a nearby, thankfully less lethal, teapot.

> 저는 태환이에요 만나서 반가워요~!

A wave of nervous laughter ripples through the remaining patrons of the teahouse as Taehwan's unexpectedly cheerful greeting hangs in the air. The burly owner, still clutching his teapot, stares at you with a mixture of bewilderment and cautious relief. A young woman, her face peeking from behind a screen, offers a shy, hesitant smile.

Game saved!

> Sharply turn to the young woman and approach her, "성함이 어떻게 되세요?"

Taehwan turns sharply, his sudden movement causing the young woman to gasp slightly. He approaches with a confident stride, his question, "성함이 어떻게 되세요?" (What is your name?), delivered with a respectful yet direct tone. Her eyes widen, a blush rising on her cheeks as she hesitates before answering.

Game saved!

> Smile and drop the owner's tanto so i don't seem crazy

With a reassuring smile, Taehwan carefully drops the tanto to the floor with a soft clink. The tension in the teahouse visibly eases; the young woman's blush deepens, and the burly owner visibly relaxes his grip on the teapot. The air, thick with fear moments before, now carries the scent of jasmine tea and a burgeoning sense of… awkward possibility.

> 얼글이 너무 빠라서 감기 걸리신거에요?

The young woman, startled by your unexpected comment ("Is your face so pale because you have a cold?"), clutches her teacup, her blush deepening into a vibrant crimson. A nervous giggle escapes her lips as she tries to answer, but her words are lost in a sudden, overwhelming cough. The teahouse owner, however, seems to understand perfectly, chuckling softly and offering her a comforting pat on the back.

> 아 얼굴이 빨개져서 발열이 난거 같아요

The young woman, flustered by your observation about her flushed face ("It seems your face is red because you have a fever"), stammers a reply, her eyes darting nervously between you and the teahouse owner. A comfortable silence settles, punctuated only by the gentle clinking of teacups and the soft murmur of conversation from other patrons, now cautiously returning to their tea. The air crackles with a mixture of awkwardness and unexpected flirtation.

> 자지를 바지안에서 빼놓아

A stunned silence falls over the teahouse. The young woman recoils sharply, her face draining of color, while the teahouse owner stares at Taehwan with a mixture of horror and disbelief, his hand instinctively reaching for the tanto he'd previously lost. The air, once thick with awkward flirtation, now crackles with the potential for a very different kind of conflict.

> 자지를 다시 바지안에서 감추어

The teahouse erupts in a collective gasp. The young woman screams, scrambling away from Taehwan, while the burly owner lunges, grabbing the discarded tanto with a furious roar. The brief, awkward flirtation is definitively over, replaced by a very real and potentially dangerous confrontation.

Game saved!

> 자지를 감춰

The teahouse explodes into a furious melee. The burly owner, fueled by rage and wielding the tanto, charges Taehwan, while the other patrons scatter in terror, screaming and knocking over tables in their haste to escape the suddenly volatile situation. The scent of jasmine tea is overwhelmed by the metallic tang of blood, as the fight begins.

Game saved!

> 위험하지않은 마법을 걸어

Taehwan murmurs the incantation, and a soft, golden light emanates from his fingertips, washing over the teahouse. The chaotic scene stills; the enraged owner freezes mid-lunge, the tanto clattering to the floor. A wave of calm washes over the room, replacing the fear and violence with an unsettling, almost dreamlike quiet.

Game saved!

> 여자를 따라가

Taehwan follows the young woman, her hurried retreat leading him through a maze of bustling city streets, the lingering golden glow of his spell still faintly illuminating her path. The unsettling quiet from the teahouse is replaced by the vibrant chaos of Ulkyung's evening market, a stark contrast to the recent violence. Her destination remains unknown, but her pace suggests urgency and perhaps, a hidden vulnerability.

Game saved!

> 죽 따라가

Taehwan silently follows the young woman, her hurried steps a blur in the twilight market. The path leads away from the main thoroughfares, down a narrow alley reeking of fish and old secrets, her pace quickening as if she senses she is being followed. A sudden, sharp turn reveals a hidden courtyard, shrouded in shadow and the scent of unfamiliar herbs.

Game saved!

> 코트야드를 들어가

Taehwan enters the hidden courtyard, the air instantly cooler and heavy with the scent of unfamiliar herbs and damp earth. A low stone wall surrounds a small, overgrown garden, and in the center stands a weathered, moss-covered well, its rope and bucket long since rotted away. The young woman stands with her back to him, her shoulders shaking slightly.

> 야 너 왜 도망갔니

The young woman whirls around, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and… something else. A single tear tracks a path through the grime on her cheek as she whispers, her voice barely audible above the chirping of crickets, "Because... because I thought you were going to... hurt me." She clutches a small, intricately carved wooden box close to her chest.

> 그런 일은 절대 없을거야 꼭 믿어줘야지

The young woman stares at Taehwan, her fear slowly giving way to a hesitant trust as she considers his words ("I would never do such a thing. You must believe me"). A faint blush returns to her cheeks, and she loosens her grip on the intricately carved wooden box, a single tear tracing a fresh path down her dirt-stained face. The silence hangs heavy between them, broken only by the night's gentle sounds.

Game saved!

> 왜우니

The young woman, startled by Taehwan's question ("Why are you crying?"), shrinks back slightly, clutching the small wooden box tighter. A fresh wave of tears wells in her eyes, and she looks away, her voice barely a whisper, "It's... it's nothing." The unspoken weight of her sorrow hangs heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the city just beyond the courtyard walls.

Game saved!

> 야 넌 너무 불믿음직하게 말하면 난 어떻게 해야할지도 몰라

The young woman flinches at Taehwan's words ("You're making it so hard for me to trust you"), her grip tightening on the intricately carved wooden box. A tear escapes, tracing a new path down her cheek as she finally speaks, her voice trembling, revealing a vulnerability that belies her earlier fear. She whispers, "It's... it's about the box."

Game saved!

> 상자는 왜? 마법 상자야?

The young woman hesitates, then slowly opens the intricately carved wooden box. Inside, nestled on faded velvet, rests a single, shimmering pearl, pulsing with a faint, inner light. A wave of potent magic washes over Taehwan, revealing the pearl to be a powerful artifact, imbued with ancient, forgotten energies.

Game saved!

> 와우 진주네

The young woman gasps, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and apprehension as you exclaim over the pearl. The pearl pulses brighter, its inner light intensifying, bathing the courtyard in an ethereal glow. A low hum resonates from the artifact, a song of ancient power awakening.

Game saved!

> 근데 왜 울고있었니

The young woman’s shoulders tremble, and she finally confesses, her voice choked with tears, "It's... it's cursed. The pearl... it feeds on sorrow, and I couldn't bear to let anyone else suffer its touch." She clutches the box tighter, her gaze fixed on the pulsing pearl.

Game saved!

> 넌 누구랑 차집에 있었지?

The young woman flinches, her eyes darting nervously around the courtyard. A blush creeps up her neck as she whispers, "I... I was alone. I... I was waiting for someone, but..." She trails off, unable to meet Taehwan's gaze, the pulsing pearl casting an unsettling glow on her tear-stained face.

Game saved!

> 이름이 모야

The young woman hesitates, her eyes downcast, before whispering a name barely audible above the humming pearl: "Seraphina." A single tear escapes, tracing a glistening path through the dirt on her cheek, as she clutches the cursed box a little tighter.
