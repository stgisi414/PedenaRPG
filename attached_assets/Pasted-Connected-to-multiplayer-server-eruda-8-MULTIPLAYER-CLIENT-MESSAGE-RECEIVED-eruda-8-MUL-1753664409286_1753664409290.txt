you said "Looking at the logs, I can see the issue now. The client logs show:

Player connects successfully (connected message)
Player gets "Room not found" error first
Player successfully joins room (room_joined message)
Player receives room updates
BUT there are NO SERVER-SIDE DEBUG MESSAGES at all! This means the server console logging I added isn't working or the server isn't receiving the messages.

The problem is that we can only see client-side logs, but we need to see the server console output. The server console would show us if the handleMessage and joinRoom functions are being called.

Let me add a simple test to verify if the server is actually processing messages by making the server send a test message back to the client when it receives any message:

multiplayer-server.js
Now when you test joining a room, you should see test_connectivity messages in the client logs. If you see these messages, it proves the server is receiving and processing messages. If you don't see them, then there's a fundamental issue with the WebSocket connection or server setup.

Please run this and show me what happens - specifically look for any test_connectivity messages in the client logs. This will tell us if the server is actually receiving the join_room messages at all." BUT THE LOGS ARE STILL THE SAME 60 MESSAGES NOW ABOUT THIS SAME TOPIC I WANT A REFUND
