> travel to the Old Well

Vilidius walks along the cobblestone path, leaving Pedena Town Square behind. The path is quiet, lined with overgrown weeds and the occasional stray dog. After a short walk, Vilidius arrives at the Old Well.

You arrive at Old Well of Pedena.

Travel time: 5 minutes

> examine the bottom of the well

Peering down into the inky blackness of the Old Well, you see nothing but impenetrable darkness at first. Then, as your eyes adjust, a faint, ethereal glow emanates from a small, ornate chest nestled amongst the rocks at the well's bottom. A chilling whisper seems to rise from the depths, urging you to claim its contents.

> use a strength check to climb down

You grip the damp, moss-covered stones, your muscles straining with the effort. With a grunt, you manage to descend into the well, the rough stone scraping against your armor. The ethereal glow of the chest grows brighter as you near the bottom.

> open the chest

As you heave open the ornate chest, a blinding flash of light erupts, momentarily stunning you. When your vision clears, you find yourself staring at a single, shimmering pearl, pulsing with an inner light, and a small, leather-bound book. A low growl echoes from the unseen depths of the well.
