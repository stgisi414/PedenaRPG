A jagged shard of obsidian, seemingly broken from the spire itself. It pulses faintly with a malevolent energy, and feels strangely warm to the touch despite the chilling air of the chamber.

A faint whisper seems to emanate from the shard, promising forbidden pleasures and untold strength... at a price.

The Obsidian Pheromone

The Succubus's Whisper
RARE

Drop
The Succubus's Whisper
RARE
A small, obsidian shard, warm to the touch, pulsing faintly with an inner light. Its surface is etched with intricate, almost invisible runes that seem to shift and writhe when held. It emits a faint, alluring scent, similar to the succubus's intoxicating perfume, but subtly different, hinting at a deeper, more primal pleasure. Holding it evokes a feeling of intense, focused desire, but only for experiences that offer true, unadulterated pleasure. Attempts to use it for purely carnal gratification result in a chilling wave of emptiness.

Value: 25 gold

Drop
The Obsidian Shroud of Patience
EPIC

Wearing it grants the wearer increased magical resilience and a measure of control over their emotions, specifically suppressing impulsive urges and enhancing focus. The amulet subtly absorbs ambient magical energy, slowly replenishing its power. Its surface is etched with ancient runes that whisper of self-control and unwavering resolve.
