There's no logging in the MULTIPLAYER CLIENT showing anything related to updating the joining player's location either. HOLY FUCK THIS IS 30 FUCKING MESSAGES ABOUT THIS AND THREE HOURS!!!!!!!!!!! THREE FUCKING HOURS AND NO PROGRESS THERE IS NO UPDATE AND THERE'S NO UPDATE LOGGING!!! LET ME REPEAT THAT FOR YOU YOU FUCKING RETARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THERE IS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOCATION UPDATE THERE IS NOOOOOOOOOO SUCCESSFUL LOCATION MESSAGE THERE IS NOOOOOOOOOOO MULTIPLAYER SYNCHRONIZATION edit: You said "The multiplayer client is connecting and receiving messages, but there's no location_changed message being sent when a player joins a room." BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE!!!!!!!!!! THE MULTIPLAYER CLIENT IS NOT UPDATING THE LOCATION AT ALL edit: You said "the WebSocket connection might not be fully established or the client might not be ready to receive them." THEN HOW THE FUCK IS THE ACTUAL MULTIPLAYER WORKING!?!?!?!?!!??! THE ONLY PART OF THE MULTIPLAYER THAT'S NOT WORKING IS THE LOCATION SYNC edit: Connected to multiplayer server
