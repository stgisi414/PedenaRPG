Taehwan - Serpent's Tooth Tavern
Level: 7 HP: 140/140
Game loaded!

Welcome back, Taehwan! You are in Serpent's Tooth Tavern.

> Mara will you be my girlfriend?

Mara's eyes, still slightly glazed from the cosmic chronic, meet yours. A slow smile spreads across her lips, but her expression remains enigmatic. "Perhaps," she purrs, her voice husky with amusement, "after another orb of that… *earthy* concoction."

> Conjure more cosmic chronic

With another flourish of your hands, a second, slightly larger orb of shimmering green cosmic chronic materializes, its scent even richer than before, hinting at galaxies far, far away. Fundina cheers wildly, already reaching for it, while Mara watches with a knowing smirk, a glint of anticipation in her eyes. The air crackles with barely contained magical energy.

> Be my girlfriend and I'll do anything for you

Mara’s smirk deepens, her eyes twinkling with amusement and a hint of challenge. "Anything?" she whispers, leaning closer, her breath warm against your ear. The unspoken promise hangs heavy in the air, thick with the scent of cosmic chronic and anticipation.

> Anything. I promsie. I'll raise the moon for you

Mara laughs, a low, throaty sound that sends shivers down your spine. Her eyes, alight with mischief and a newfound cosmic understanding, lock onto yours. "Then prove it, mage," she purrs, a playful challenge in her voice. The moon, hanging high in the tavern's surprisingly clear sky, seems to shimmer in response.

> cast plane shift to move us all forward in time so the moon raises

Taehwan attempts to cast Plane Shift to advance time, but the spell misfires. The tavern remains the same, but the moon is now visible in the night sky.

> I did it

The tavern's surprisingly clear sky suddenly swirls with iridescent energy, then snaps back to normal, the moon now noticeably higher in the arc of its journey across the heavens. Mara bursts into laughter, a sound both delighted and slightly unnerving, before leaning in and kissing you soundly. Fundina, meanwhile, is still giggling, completely oblivious to the temporal manipulation just witnessed.

Game saved!

> I'm so glad you're my girlfriend Mara

Mara, still flushed from the kiss and the lingering effects of the cosmic chronic, wraps her arms around you, her laughter echoing softly in the tavern. "Glad to be yours, mage," she whispers, her voice husky with affection. Fundina, ever the oblivious one, continues her merry giggling, clinking her tankard against Mara's in a celebratory toast.

Background Story
Taehwan, a mage of considerable talent but quiet demeanor, hails from the shadowed alleys of Grimhold, where he learned the harsh realities of survival alongside his studies of arcane arts. He initially sought power to escape his impoverished beginnings, hoping to earn a place amongst the esteemed Order of the Crystal Flame. However, witnessing the Coalition of Merchant Princes' callous exploitation of Grimhold's populace shifted his focus towards using his magic for the betterment of the downtrodden, possibly even aligning with the Brotherhood of the Crossed Swords in his pursuit of justice.
