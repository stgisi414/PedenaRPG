> Buy a matchbook for 1 gold

The shopkeeper, a gruff dwarf with a surprisingly neatly-trimmed beard, eyes your request with a raised eyebrow. He produces a small, brass matchbook, its cover embossed with a rather crude depiction of a dragon. "One gold piece, as requested," he grunts, handing it over with a surprisingly deft flick of his wrist.

You lost 1 gold (purchase)!

Exploring the area...

Taehwan finds a dusty, leather-bound journal tucked away on a high shelf, almost hidden behind a stack of maps. The cover is unmarked, but a faint, almost imperceptible magical aura emanates from it. Genevieve Haggler, the store's owner, is polishing a particularly ornate dagger behind the counter, seemingly oblivious to Taehwan's presence.

You can interact with: journal, genevieve haggler, ornate dagger (on counter), high shelf

> Talk to the genevieve haggler

Looking for someone to talk to...

You see Botanist Lyra. Appearance: A wizened woman with bright, inquisitive eyes, her fingers stained a multitude of earthy greens and browns. She wears a simple, practical tunic patched with various fabrics, and a leather satchel overflowing with dried herbs and strange roots hangs from her shoulder. A faint scent of chamomile and something subtly…musky… clings to her. Botanist Lyra says: "Excuse me, young adventurer, but have you perhaps seen a particularly rare specimen of Nightshade Bloom? It has iridescent petals and a scent like burnt sugar..."

> No but i got this cosmic chronic i conjured from earlier

Botanist Lyra's eyes widen, her interest piqued. A knowing smile plays on her lips as she leans closer, inhaling deeply. "Cosmic Chronic, you say? That's... quite a rare find. Tell me more about its properties, and perhaps we can discuss a trade."

Botanist Lyra, eyes gleaming with avarice, carefully assesses the Cosmic Chronic, her fingers tracing its luminescent surface. She nods slowly, a shrewd glint in her eyes, then offers, "Fifteen gold pieces is a fair price... but I'll sweeten the deal. I'll add a rare potion of healing in exchange for this extraordinary…herb."
