Your adventure begins in Pedena Town Square.</p><p class="mb-2 pb-1 border-b border-amber-700/50"><i class="ra ra-quill mr-2"></i>The midday sun beat down on Pedena Town Square, baking the cobblestones to a shimmering haze. JulesTest, barely a man, clutched his worn leather-bound sword – a gift from his late father – its weight a comforting anchor against the churning anxiety in his gut. This was it. No more tending sheep, no more whispered dreams of glory. A gruff voice bellowed from the shadowed alleyway across the square: "Lost lamb needs a shepherd, eh? Heard you were lookin' for work, kid. Got a job that'll either make you a legend… or fertilizer." JulesTest's heart hammered. This was no sheep-herding. This was adventure.</p><p class="mb-2 pb-1 border-b border-amber-700/50"><i class="ra ra-quill mr-2"></i>Seeking new adventures...</p><p class="mb-2 pb-1 border-b border-amber-700/50 text-green-700"><i class="ra ra-check mr-2"></i>New quest available: Whispers from the Old Well</p><p class="mb-2 pb-1 border-b border-amber-700/50"><i class="ra ra-quill mr-2"></i>A hooded figure, their face obscured by shadow, approaches you in the Pedena Town Square.
